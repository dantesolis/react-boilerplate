#### React Basic Project Setup

This is just a simple folder structure template to use for my `React` projects.


##### What's inside

Check the `devDependencies` inside `package.json`, but basically

- webpack
- babel
- babel-loader
-
-

Get them with `npm install --save-dev packageName`

##### License

- Check LICENSE.md
