### What's inside (technologies)

Check the `devDependencies` inside `package.json`, but basically

- react
- webpack
- babel
- babel-loader
- node-static (run it with `static .` and it serves it at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`)
- jest-cli * (requires a bit more of a setup)

Get them with `npm install --save-dev packageName`
