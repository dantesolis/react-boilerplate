### What's inside (technologies)

Check the `devDependencies` & `dependencies` inside `package.json`, but basically

- react
- react-dom
- react-router
- webpack
- babel-core
- babel-preset-react
- babel-loader
- node-static (run it with `static .` and it serves it at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`)
- jest-cli * (requires a bit more of a setup)

Get them with `npm install --save-dev packageName` or `npm install --save packageName`

### Usage

Start the development server with this command `npm start`

### Setup
---

`npm install`

### Todo
