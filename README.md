## React Basic Project Setup

This is just a simple folder structure template to use for my `React` projects.


#### What's inside

Check the `devDependencies` inside `package.json`, but basically

- webpack
- babel
- babel-loader
- node-static (run it with `static .` and it serves it at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`)
-

Get them with `npm install --save-dev packageName`

### License

- Check LICENSE.md
